ozp-iwc-owf7-widget-adapter
===========================

This allows an existing OWF 7 widget to "ride on top" of the OZP IWC bus.

The recommended approach for migrating OWF applications to OZP/IWC is to refactor the application to use IWC directly and skip the legacy adapter entirely. There are only two scenarios that warrant use of the Legacy Adapter:

1. You have an immediate need to shut down your existing OWF infrastructure (and replacing it with OZP infrastructure is an option)

2. There are new OZP/IWC applications using (IWC) intents that your OWF application needs to communicate with as soon as possible (e.g. it will take several months to refactor your OWF application to use IWC and it needs to be working with existing IWC applications using Intents in the meantime)


## OWF 7 API support
See IWC-Mapped Actions.xlsx for details.

* Working
  * Eventing
  * Drag & Drop
  * Launcher
  * Preferences
* Future Support
  * Intents
  * RPC
  * State
* Webtop-dependent
  * Chrome
* Not prioritized
  * Metrics
  * Log

## Drag & Drop caveats
OWF7 did not use the HTML5 drag and drop.  This creates some artifacts when running outside of the webtop.
* Drag indicators will only appear over OWF 7 widgets.
* There's a 3 pixel white "gutter" around the widget that calibrate's it's location on the screen.  Drag indicators may not appear in the correct place until the mouse crosses this gutter.

## OWF and OZP IWC cross-communications.
The OWF API is mapped to a subset of IWC functionality, placing the onus on the IWC application to support backward compatibility with legacy widgets.  Guides and helper libraries for this are forthcoming.

# For Widget Developers

## Initial Checklist
* Do you include owf-widget-min.js in your widget AND use `Ozone.*` or `OWF.*` Javascript APIs?
  * NO:  You don't need the adapter.
* Does your OZP provider automatically wrap OWF 7 widgets?
  * YES:  Follow their instructions on how to mark your widget as requiring the adapter.


## Wrapping your widget
1. Get the adapter URL for your OZP provider.  Usually it will be the IWC Bus URL followed by `owf7adapter.html`.
2. Find your widget's launch URL.  Usually found in your provider's MarketPlace or your widget descriptor.
3. Pass your launch URL through `encodeURIComponent`.  You can use [this tool](http://pressbin.com/tools/urlencode_urldecode/) or type `encodeURIComponent('http://widget.example.com')` on your browsers developer tools console.
4. Start with the adapter URL, add `?url=`, and finish with your encoded launch URL.

###Example:

1. Adapter URL= https://ozp.example.com
2. Widget Launch URL= https://widget.example.com
3. Encoded Launch URL= https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com
4. Wrapped URL = https://ozp.example.com?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com

Follow your OZP providers instructions on how to update your widget's launch URL to the wrapped URL.

Installation
============
Note:  This only needs to be done when building an OZP backend.  If you're not sure that you need to
install the legacy adapter, then you don't.
* Widget developers do NOT need to do this.  It should be handled by your OZP provider.
* All packaged OZP distributions should have this built-in or instructions on how to enable it.


1. Drop the contents of `dist` into the same directory as the IWC (i.e. owf7adapter.html and iframe_peer.html in the same directory).
2. Modify `owf7adapter.html` if the defaults are not correct (`ozpIwc.apiRootUrl="api"; ozpIwc.owf7PrefsUrl="/owf/prefs";`)
