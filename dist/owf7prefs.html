			This doesn't actually do anything right now.
			
			TODO:
	<li> Make this a peer, but don't load any APIs (would cause them to freeze for leader election)
	<li> InternalParticipant to query the kvStore for the pref, based upon the value.
	<li> Any write does a post to the url, which keeps this trick from working seemlessly.  Need server collusion
		to add params, put in body, or just flat out service the request on it's own.
